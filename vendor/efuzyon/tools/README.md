eFuzyon v1.0
=======

1. OVERVIEW

The "eFuzyon Tools" was created by "eFuzyon Technology" to help PHP developers
with boring tasks like cleaning up strings, generating URI strings, and others.

Our main goal is to increase your productivity while maintaining or creating a 
certain degree of organization on your code.

As this project evolves, we'll try to increase the range of classes and methods
to help a number even bigger of developers.

Let us know if you have any classes or methods to be included on the project.
You can track our development at https://github.com/eFuzyon/tools/

check the "demo" folder for usage examples.
